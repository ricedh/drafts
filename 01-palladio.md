This page discusses the geographic digital tool Palladio and its use to visualize paths of runaway slaves collected from capture notices.

## Rationale
*What's the point?*

Scholarship on fugitive slaves has identified several geographic trends in the directions taken by runaways. Some slaves temporarily "laid out" in the vicinity of their owner's farm or plantation, while others ran farther with the intent to stay with relatives or to reach freedom. Franklin and Schweninger's research found that "slaves living in the Lower Mississippi River Valley or in Mississippi and Alabama were more likely to run south and west than north," making Texas and Mexico possible destinations for runaway slaves [(Franklin and Schweninger, 112)](index.html#bibliography).

After a close reading of runaway slave advertisements from Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas newspapers, we hypothesized that Texas had different runaway destination patterns than the other two states. William Dean Carrigan, in his article “Slavery on the frontier: the peculiar institution in central Texas” portrays Texas as “a world torn in three directions by four different cultures” [(Carrigan, 64)](index.html#bibliography). Both the presence of Native American tribes and the proximity of Mexico helped to define Texas as a borderland through which many slaves passed to get to freedom.

In terms of the other states, in Arkansas, many jailer notices advertised captured slaves originally from states to the east, indicating that Arkansas was also a popular destination or point on the route to freedom. Out of the three states compared in this research, Mississippi is the most representative of a typical Southern slave-holding state, in that it was well-established and not a borderland state. From these patterns of advertisement in relationship to other states, Mississippi provides a barometer of normalcy that allows comparison of differences in Arkansas and Texas.

However, the trends we discovered through close reading have there limitations. As an initial method of familiarizing ourselves with the data, close reading is beneficial, but it is difficult to find patterns by simply reading through a corpus of runaway slave advertisements. In only a few advertisements did slave owners mention a location where their slave might be running. Even when a slave owner did mention a destination, that location oftentimes only represented where the the owner guessed the runaway was headed. One slave owner in an 1836 ad from the [*Arkansas Gazette*](http://aquila.usm.edu/drs/4/) was more candid than most when he said, “I have dreamed, with both eyes open, that he went toward the Spanish county; but as dreams are like some would be thought honest men―quite uncertain―he may have gone some other directions.” Even when they did not directly state it, however, slave owners did subtly acknowledge their lack of complete knowledge of where their slaves were headed.

One source of information that provides a truer sense of runaways' start and end locations available to historians is jailers' notices, a data set that Franklin and Schweninger did not utilize in analyzing slaves' projected destinations. Many jailers' notices contain information about where the slave had run from or where his or her owner lived. Although we generally cannot tell which routes runaway slaves took to get to their destinations, simply connecting points at their start location and where where they were captured gives us an idea about where they were heading. The web application Palladio enabled us to visualize these potential paths.

## Methodology
*How we made the maps.*

To create our maps using Palladio, we first chose two sets of jailers' notices from each of the states. Jailers' notices were the best choice for visualizing runaway paths because they almost universally list the owner's location as reported by the runaway, thereby providing two locations for mapping: the county jail and the reported owner location. The Bexar, Pulaski, and Jefferson county jails provided a suitable sample, since they each had a similar number of advertisements, about 20, and were all from the late 1850s. In addition, we used the set of all jailers' notices advertised in each state over the years 1840 to 1842.

We then manually entered geographic data from these three samples into a spreadsheet. We stored information on the owner's location and the location of the county jail where the runaway was held after being captured. We also created a spreadsheet containing the geographic coordinates for each location.

Next, we uploaded our data to [Palladio](http://palladio.designhumanities.org/) for visualization. After merging the "from" and "to" locations with geographic coordinates, we were able to begin visualizing the data. We choose the "Point to Point" option for map type in order to visualize as the direction slaves ran. By creating separate maps for each state, we were able to draw conclusions about differences in runaway patterns across the South.

Although Palladio's features are currently limited, one that proved useful to us was the "Count by" option. With it enabled, shaded circles of varying size depict the frequency of each location in the data set, as shown in the following image.

## Conclusions
*Findings, questions, and limitations.*

Using Palladio as a tool for both visualization and analysis, we produced the following results from the data sets.

As shown above, jailers' notices between 1840 and 1842 follow no discernible pattern, and the maps are difficult to interpret. T
