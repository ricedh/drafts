# Rationale

Scholarship on fugitive slaves has identified several geographic trends in the directions taken by runaways. Some slaves ran toward the freedom of the North, but until Canada was reached, fugitive slave laws enforced the capture and return of slaves to their owners in the South. Slaves seeking freedom also headed west, both toward frontier states and toward Mexico, where a fugitive slave law was not in effect to return runaways to the United States. Some slaves, however, were inspired to find reunion with family members, often after being sold west away from their relatives. These trends, then, set the stage for the observations gathered from the runaway slave advertisements.

Through a close reading of runaway slave advertisements from Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas newspapers, we began to see geographic differences. William Dean Carrigan, in his article “Slavery on the frontier: the peculiar institution in central Texas” sets Texas up as “a world torn in three directions by four different cultures.” The Native American tribes and the Mexican border both helped to define Texas as a borderland through which many slaves passed to get to freedom. Many jailer notices in Arkansas advertise captured slaves originally from more eastern states, indicating that Arkansas was also a popular destination or point on the route to freedom. Given the three states compared in this research, Mississippi is the most similar to typical Southern slave-holding states, in that it was well-established and not a borderland state. From these patterns of advertisement in relationship to other states,  Mississippi provides a barometer of “normalcy” that allows comparison of differences in Arkansas and Texas.

However, it is sometimes difficult to find patterns by simply reading through a corpus of runaway slave advertisements. Only a few slave owners mentioned a location to where a slave might be running in advertisements. Even if a slave owner provided a location, it often only shows what the owner perceived of his slave. A slaveowner in an 1836 ad from the *Arkansas Gazette* stated that “I have dreamed, with both eyes open, that he went toward the Spanish county; but as dreams are like some would be thought honest men―quite uncertain―he may have gone some other directions.” Although most fugitive slave advertisements were slightly less flowery in their language, the inaccuracies of projected direction were subtly acknowledged in the advertisements.

One of the only ways we can see which direction a slave was running in our collection of runaway ads is through jailer's notices. Many jailer's notices contained information about where the slave had run from or where his or her owner was located. Although we generally cannot tell the route that slaves were taking to get to their destinations, connecting paths between where they ran from and where they were captured can give us an idea about where they were possibly heading. Palladio provided us with the necessary tools to visualize these potential paths.

# Methodology

How the Palladio maps were made, step by step.

The first step was finding an appropriate sample from each of the states. Given the capabilities of Palladio, jailer's notices seemed the most beneficial option, since the maps produced would be unified by a single destination. The Bexar, Pulaski, and Jefferson county jails provided a suitable set, since they each had a similar number of advertisements (about 20) and were from around the same time period (the late 1850s).

Data from these three samples was then manually entered into a spreadsheet, which specifically included information on the reported owner location and the runaway location (the county jail). A separate spreadsheet was created with the geographic coordinates listed beside these locations.

The next step was incorporation of this information into the digital visualization tool of [Palladio](http://palladio.designhumanities.org/). After the first spreadsheet (with owner and runaway locations) was uploaded as the primary table, the interface appeared as follows (INSERT SCREENSHOT). Clicking the "Review" or "Extend" button adjacent to reported owner location allowed for addition of the location coordinate information through the "Add a New Table"  option. After the location coordinate table was also added to runaway location, visualization through mapping was possible.

A small earth icon marks the mapping visualization of the uploaded data. Choosing "Point to Point" Under "Map type" revealed "Source Places" and "Destination Places" with dropdown menus of the available data. Selecting "Reported Owner Location" and "Runaway Location" in the respective menus created the following map visualizations (INCLUDE SCREENSHOTS).

Although not many features are currently available through Palladio, the "Count by" option allows a representation of frequency through size points (INCLUDE SCREENSHOT)

*possible additional points: variability of data entry for location, as well as lack of specificity for coordinates; palladio screenshots; other options through palladio?
