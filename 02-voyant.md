# Rationale

Digital text-mining tools can help researchers understand document collections that are prohibitively large for a close-reading. Our collection of runaway slave advertisements from Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi totals over 2,500 individual ads! Not only would it be extremely time consuming to read this entire collection, the consistently short, boilerplate format of runaway ads can make it difficult to really distinguish between them. The ads from Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi start to all look practically indistinguishable, making it difficult for close-reading alone to recognize pattern breaks between the states, without the assistance of computational data. This is where Voyant comes in. We hoped that the “distant-reading” capabilities of Voyant would be able to pick up on larger word usage trends that are not immediately apparent when reading with the human eye.

Additionally, as we read through our initial collection of Texas runaway ads, it became clear that these ads tell us little about the perspectives of runaway slaves themselves. Information about the slave is always filtered through the attitudes and beliefs of the slaveholder. Working within the limitations of this category of primary source, we became increasingly interested in analyzing this language of the slaveholders. In what sort of discourse on slavery were these subscribers engaged, and were there any differences across state lines? Across time? Voyant’s efficient “reading” skills and visualization capabilities make it easy to immediately spot differences between multiple corpuses or trends across one corpus. As students who have primarily worked with close-reading in the past, digital text-mining tools such as Voyant offer another angle of analysis into a text.

# Methodology

[Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org/) is a free, online text-analysis resource. Among its tools, it generates a word cloud of most frequent words, generates graphs of word frequency across the corpus, and lets you compare multiple documents. Once you have a text uploaded, you can play around a lot within the Voyant “skin”, opening and closing different tools, or clicking on a particular word to see trends for that word specifically. It’s also possible to generate a link to the skin that can then be shared or embedded into a page, allowing others to play around with the data on their own.

# Conclusions

Findings, questions, limitations.
