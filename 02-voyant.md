Open with an embedded image from Voyant, and a [link to the full corpus of Texas ads](http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=1398028124350.4052&stopList=stop.en.taporware.txt).

# Rationale

Why did we want to use Voyant? (Might be worth talking here about how the limitations of the corpus---the fact that it can't tell us about every slave who ran away---drove us to thinking about the discourse of the ads.)

# Methodology

How to use Voyant to do basic text mining.

Voyant is a free, online text-analysis resource. Among its tools, it generates a word cloud of most frequent words, generates graphs of word frequency across the corpus, and lets you compare multiple documents. Once you have a text uploaded, you can play around a lot within the Voyant “skin”, opening and closing different tools, or clicking on a particular word to see trends for that word specifically. It’s also possible to generate a link to the skin that can then be shared or embedded into a page, allowing others to play around with the data on their own.

# Conclusions

Findings, questions, limitations.
