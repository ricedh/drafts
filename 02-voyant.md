# Rationale

Why did we want to use Voyant? (Might be worth talking here about how the limitations of the corpus---the fact that it can't tell us about every slave who ran away---drove us to thinking about the discourse of the ads.)

# Methodology

How to use Voyant to do basic text mining.

# Conclusions

Findings, questions, limitations.
