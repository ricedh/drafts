Working drafts of articles for final project

The basic structure of the final project site will consist of an [introduction](00-introduction.md) splash page, written by Dr. McDaniel. The splash page is going to contain screenshots of the results of our various projects, modeled on [this page](http://dsl.richmond.edu/projects/). Each screenshot will link to a fuller essay answering these questions:

- What is it? (one paragraph description)
- Why did we make it? (rationale)
- How did we make it? (methodology)
- What next? (conclusions, questions, limitations of the method)

Here's the checklist of things we need to do by **Friday, 08:00 AM**.

## Markdown resources

- [Mastering Markdown](http://guides.github.com/overviews/mastering-markdown/) on GitHub-flavored Markdown
- [Dingus](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus), a sandbox for testing Markdown syntax
- For the curious, [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), a free program that can actually convert Markdown files into a variety of other file formats, including Microsoft Word files, PDF documents, and standalone HTML websites.
