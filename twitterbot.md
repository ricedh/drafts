# Introduction to TxRunawayAds

The [@TxRunawayAds](http://twitter.com/TxRunawayAds) account tweets excerpts from advertisements related to runaway slaves in nineteenth-century Texas newspapers, along with links to the page images of the ad in the [Portal to Texas History](http://texashistory.unt.edu).

The tweeted excerpts come from ads identified and transcribed in the spring of 2014 by students in two digital history courses at [Rice University](http://digitalhistory.blogs.rice.edu) and the [University of North Texas](http://torget.us/HIST5100/), taught respectively by Caleb McDaniel and Andrew Torget. The excerpts and links are composed and tweeted automatically with a [script](https://github.com/ricedh/adbot) written by Caleb McDaniel.

## Rationale

### Why Runaway Slave Advertisements?

- Why are runaway slave advertisements useful sources?

### Why Twitter?

Since people often go to Twitter to relax and read funny tweets, it may initialy seem odd to encounter a sobering subject like slavery in the middle of a stream. On the other hand, seeing ads in this context may help to convey the prevalence and the everyday nature of the ads in 19th century newspapers. When looking for ads, students noticed that nineteenth-century newspapers often contained lighthearted poems, humorous stories, or notices of local events.

To twenty-first-century readers, one of the disturbing aspects about these ads is how they are mixed into the rest of the newspaper in such a mundane way. By publishing our ads mixed into a Twitter feed, among all the jokes and day-to-day updates, we hope to communicate the both the jarring effect on students of finding the ads initially, and the familiarity that made white nineteenth-century readers see the advertisements as a normal feature of their world.

- Surfacing of significant ads like [the one about William Marsh Rice](http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth235886/m1/3/zoom/?zoom=5&lat=8260&lon=3904).

### Why Texas?

Compared to research on slavery in other Southern states, not much research has been done on slavery or runaway slave advertisements in Texas.

John Hope Franklin and Loren Schweningerâ€™s *Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the Plantation*, one of the most comprehensive projects on runaway slaves in the South, does not even include Texas in the data or analysis, but rather implies that slavery seems to be relatively uniform throughout the South. Randolph B. Campbell advanced the discussion on slavery in Texas through his book *An Empire for Slavery: The Peculiar Institution in Texas, 1821-1865*, but agreed with Franklin and Schweninger on the similarities between Texas and slavery elsewhere. Other scholars, however, suggest that slavery in Texas (specifically in central Texas) was unique from that in other Southern states and offered unusual opportunities for resistance and flight to enslaved people due to Texas's proximity to Mexico and Indian nations. The tweets from [@TxRunawayAds](http://twitter.com/TxRunawayAds) will hopefully prompt renewed attention to these debates and suggest new lines of research about the subject.

- PoTH offers one of the few resources where ads can be seen easily in their original context.

## About the Sources

The [@TxRunawayAds](http://twitter.com/TxRunawayAds) currently selects randomly from approximately 380 advertisements located in issues of the [*Telegraph and Texas Register*](http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eet02) and the [*Austin State Gazette*](http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eeayy) from between the years of 1836 and 1860. For more information about these newspapers and the Portal to Texas History, visit the [Mapping Texts](http://mappingtexts.org) project, an NEH collaboration between Stanford University and the University of North Texas.
