The [@TxRunawayAds](http://twitter.com/TxRunawayAds) tweets regular excerpts from advertisements related to runaway slaves in nineteenth-century Texas newspapers, along with links to the page images of the ad in the [Portal to Texas History](http://texashistory.unt.edu).

The tweeted excerpts come from ads identified and transcribed in the spring of 2014 by students in two digital history courses at Rice University and the University of North Texas, taught respectively by Caleb McDaniel and Andrew Torget. The excerpts and links are composed and tweeted automatically with a [script](https://github.com/ricedh/adbot) written by Caleb McDaniel.
