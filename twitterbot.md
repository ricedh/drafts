The [@TxRunawayAds](http://twitter.com/TxRunawayAds) account tweets regular excerpts from advertisements related to runaway slaves in nineteenth-century Texas newspapers, along with links to the page images of the ad in the [Portal to Texas History](http://texashistory.unt.edu).

The tweeted excerpts come from ads identified and transcribed in the spring of 2014 by students in two digital history courses at [Rice University](http://digitalhistory.blogs.rice.edu) and the [University of North Texas](http://torget.us/HIST5100/), taught respectively by Caleb McDaniel and Andrew Torget. The excerpts and links are composed and tweeted automatically with a [script](https://github.com/ricedh/adbot) written by Caleb McDaniel.

## Rationale

### Why Runaway Slave Advertisements?

### Why Twitter?

Since people often go to Twitter to relax and read funny tweets, it may initialy seem odd to encounter a sobering subject like slavery in the middle of a stream. On the other hand, seeing ads in this context may help to convey the prevalence and the everyday nature of the ads in 19th century newspapers. When looking for ads, students noticed that nineteenth-century newspapers often contained lighthearted poems, humorous stories, or notices of local events.

To twenty-first-century readers, one of the disturbing aspects about these ads is how they are mixed into the rest of the newspaper in such a mundane way. By publishing our ads mixed into a Twitter feed, among all the jokes and day-to-day updates, we hope to communicate the both the jarring effect on students of finding the ads initially, and the familiarity that made white nineteenth-century readers see the advertisements as a normal feature of their world.
