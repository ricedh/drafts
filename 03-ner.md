# Rationale

The method of close-reading runaway slave advertisements between 1835 and 1865 allows for an exploration of whether patterns of listed locations differ between the states, specifically in relationship to how Texas trends might differ. Various newspapers from Mississippi, Texas, and Arkansas provide the data set for this analysis.  Trends are most easily analyzed by individual state, followed by a conversation and comparison of these overall trends between the states.

# Methodology

How we got NER running, how the script works, adjustments that had to be made.

# Conclusions

Findings, questions, limitations.
